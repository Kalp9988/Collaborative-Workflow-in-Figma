##For the second task, I simulated a real-time collaborative design process in Figma. I created a shared project and invited dummy team members to the file. I demonstrated the use of Figma’s commenting system by leaving feedback notes on specific design elements, such as color choices and layout spacing. I also explored Figma’s version history to show how design changes can be tracked and restored. I took screenshots of the project sharing, comments, and version control history as part of the documentation. This task enhanced my awareness of team communication and version control in cloud-based design environments.
